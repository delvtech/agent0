    the mapping between that wallet address and any additional aliases that address may have.
    Specifically, the output dataframe contains the following columns:
        address: The original wallet address
        abbr_address: The wallet address abbreviated (e.g., 0x0000...0000)
        username: The one-to-one mapped username for that address gathered from the `addr_to_username` postgres table
        user: The many username to one user gathered from the `username_to_user` postgres table
        format_name: A formatted name for labels combining username with abbr_address
