        Arguments
        ---------
        in_ : float
            The amount of tokens that the user pays. When users receive bonds,
            this value reflects the base paid.
        share_reserves : float
            The reserves of base in the pool.
        bond_reserves : float
            The reserves of bonds (PT) in the pool.
        token_out : str
            The token that the user receives. The only valid values are "base"
            and "pt".
        fee_percent : float
            The percentage of the difference between the amount paid and the
            amount received without slippage that will be debited from the
            output as a fee.
        time_remaining : float
            The time remaining for the asset (incorporates time stretch).
        init_share_price : float
            The share price when the pool was initialized. NOTE: For this
            pricing model, the initial share price must always be one.
        share_price : float
            The current share price. NOTE: For this pricing model, the share
            price must always be one.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The amount the user receives without fees or slippage. The units
            are always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The amount the user receives with fees and slippage. The units are
            always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The amount the user receives with slippage and no fees. The units are
            always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The fee the user pays. The units are always in terms of bonds or
            base.

        Arguments
        ---------
        out : float
            The amount of tokens that the user wants to receive. When the user
            wants to pay in bonds, this value should be an amount of base tokens
            rather than an amount of shares.
        share_reserves : float
            The reserves of shares in the pool.
        bond_reserves : float
            The reserves of bonds in the pool.
        token_in : str
            The token that the user pays. The only valid values are "base" and
            "pt".
        fee_percent : float
            The percentage of the difference between the amount paid without
            slippage and the amount received that will be added to the input
            as a fee.
        time_remaining : float
            The time remaining for the asset (incorporates time stretch).
        init_share_price : float
            The share price when the pool was initialized.
        share_price : float
            The current share price.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The amount the user pays without fees or slippage. The units
            are always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The amount the user pays with fees and slippage. The units are
            always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The amount the user pays with slippage and no fees. The units are
            always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The fee the user pays. The units are always in terms of bonds or
            base.

        Arguments
        ---------
        in_ : float
            The amount of tokens that the user pays. When users receive bonds,
            this value reflects the base paid.
        share_reserves : float
            The reserves of shares in the pool.
        bond_reserves : float
            The reserves of bonds (PT) in the pool.
        token_out : str
            The token that the user receives. The only valid values are "base"
            and "pt".
        fee_percent : float
            The percentage of the difference between the amount paid and the
            amount received without slippage that will be debited from the
            output as a fee.
        time_remaining : float
            The time remaining for the asset (incorporates time stretch).
        init_share_price : float
            The share price when the pool was initialized.
        share_price : float
            The current share price.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The amount the user receives without fees or slippage. The units
            are always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The amount the user receives with fees and slippage. The units are
            always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The amount the user receives with slippage and no fees. The units are
            always in terms of bonds or base.
        float
            The fee the user pays. The units are always in terms of bonds or
            base.
