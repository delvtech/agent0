# A Framework for Hyperdrive Trading Strategies

This repo by [DELV](https://delv.tech) contain tools for you to deploy automated trading agents, perform market simulations, and conduct trading research. Read on for more info or jump to the [quickstart guide](https://agent0.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quickstart).

## Hyperdrive Background

Hyperdrive is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that enables fixed-rate markets to be built on top of arbitrary yield sources. It deploys assets into those yield sources and wraps them as Hyperdrive positions represented as hy[Tokens] that trade at a discount (%) and can be redeemed for their full face value at maturity. Since the hy[Token]’s initial cost and value at maturity are known upfront, this discounted purchase represents a fixed rate of return.

Abstracting interest rate dynamics into a single price opens up interesting Market Dynamics while giving users the freedom to employ a number of Trading Strategies.

To ensure that a balanced market exists where the market price can be increased and decreased by supply and demand, the AMM supports three basic operations:
* Opening Longs, which provides exposure to the fixed rate by purchasing hy[Tokens] at a discount to their face value for the price of forgoing the variable rate. Longs pay trading fees to the pool.
* Opening Shorts, which provides exposure to the variable rate generated by the capital that backs hy[Tokens] for the price of paying the fixed rate. Shorts pay trading fees to the pool.
* Providing Liquidity, which facilitates Long and Short trading by automatically taking the other side of user positions, and charges trading fees. Part of the pool's fees may go to a governance address.

## What is Agent0?

Agent0 is DELV's Python-based library for testing, analyzing, and interacting with Hyperdrive's smart contracts. It provides ready-for-use trading policies as well as a framework for building smart agents that act according to policies that can be strictly user-designed, AI-powered, or a combination. These agents are deployable to execute trades on-chain or can be coupled with a simulated environment to test trading strategies, understand Hyperdrive, and explore integrations or deployment configurations. 

When running Hyperdrive on a local blockchain, agent0 also provides a managed database delivered to you as Pandas dataframes via an API as well as a visualization dashboard to enable analysis and understanding.

Read more about [how agent0 works](https://docs.hyperdrive.box/hyperdrive-trading-bots/how-agent0-works) in our [docs](https://docs.hyperdrive.box/).

## Quickstart | Agent0 Repo

This repo contains general purpose code for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
However, it was built for the primary use case of trading on [Hyperdrive](https://hyperdrive.delv.tech) markets.

First, install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Next, using a Python 3.10 environment, you can install agent0 via pip:

```sh
pip install --upgrade agent0
```

Finally, you can execute Hyperdrive trades in a simulated blockchain environment:

```python
import datetime
from fixedpointmath import FixedPoint
from agent0 import LocalHyperdrive, LocalChain

# Initialize
chain = LocalChain()
hyperdrive = LocalHyperdrive(chain)
hyperdrive_agent0 = chain.init_agent(base=FixedPoint(100_000), eth=FixedPoint(10), pool=hyperdrive)

# Run trades
chain.advance_time(datetime.timedelta(weeks=1))
open_long_event = hyperdrive_agent0.open_long(base=FixedPoint(100), eth=FixedPoint(10))
chain.advance_time(datetime.timedelta(weeks=5))
close_event = hyperdrive_agent0.close_long(
    maturity_time=open_long_event.maturity_time, bonds=open_long_event.bond_amount
)

# Analyze
pool_info = hyperdrive.get_pool_info(coerce_float=True)
pool_info.plot(x="block_number", y="longs_outstanding", kind="line")
```

See our [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/delvtech/agent0/tree/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb) and 
[examples notebook](https://github.com/delvtech/agent0/tree/main/examples/short_examples.ipynb) for more information, 
including details on executing trades on remote chains.

## Install

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/delvtech/agent0/tree/main/INSTALL.md) for more advanced install options.

## Deployment

Please refer to [BUILD.md](https://github.com/delvtech/agent0/tree/main/BUILD.md).

## Testing

We deploy a local anvil chain to run system tests.
Therefore, you must [install foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installatio://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) as a prerequisite for running tests.

Testing is achieved with [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html).
You can run all tests from the repository root directory by running `python -m pytest`, or you can pick a specific test with `python -m pytest {path/to/test_file.py}`.
General integration-level tests are in the `tests` folder, while more isolated or unit tests are colocated with the files they are testing and end with a `_test.py` suffix.

## Contributions

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/delvtech/agent0/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Coverage

To run coverage locally you can follow these steps:

```bash
pip install coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

then just open `htmlcov/index.html` to view the report!

## Number format

We frequently use 18-decimal [fixed-point precision numbers](https://github.com/delvtech/fixedpointmath#readme) for arithmetic.
