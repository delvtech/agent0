# [DELV](https://delv.tech) repo for market simulation and analysis

This docs page can be found via [https://agent0.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://agent0.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Quickstart

This repo contains general purpose code for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
However, it was bulit for the primary use case of trading on [Hyperdrive](https://hyperdrive.delv.tech) markets.
Below is an example for executing Hyperdrive trades in a simulated blockchain environment:

```python
import datetime
from fixedpointmath import FixedPoint
from agent0 import ILocalHyperdrive, ILocalChain

# Initialize
chain = ILocalChain()
interactive_hyperdrive = ILocalHyperdrive(chain)
hyperdrive_agent0 = interactive_hyperdrive.init_agent(base=FixedPoint(100_000))

# Run trades
chain.advance_time(datetime.timedelta(weeks=1))
open_long_event = hyperdrive_agent0.open_long(base=FixedPoint(100))
chain.advance_time(datetime.timedelta(weeks=5))
close_event = hyperdrive_agent0.close_long(
    maturity_time=open_long_event.maturity_time, bonds=open_long_event.bond_amount
)

# Analyze
pool_state = interactive_hyperdrive.get_pool_state(coerce_float=True)
pool_state.plot(x="block_number", y="longs_outstanding", kind="line")
```

See our [tutorial notebook](examples/tutorial.ipynb) for more information, including details on executing trades on remote chains.

## Install

Install via pip: `pip install agent0`

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for more advanced install options.

## Deployment

Please refer to [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Testing

We deploy a local anvil chain to run system tests.
Therefore, you must [install foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installatio://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) as a prerequisite for running tests.

Testing is achieved with [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html).
You can run all tests from the repository root directory by running `python -m pytest`, or you can pick a specific test with `python -m pytest {path/to/test_file.py}`.
General integration-level tests are in the `tests` folder, while more isolated or unit tests are colocated with the files they are testing and end with a `_test.py` suffix.

## Contributions

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Coverage

To run coverage locally you can follow these steps:

```bash
pip install coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

then just open `htmlcov/index.html` to view the report!

## Number format

We frequently use 18-decimal [fixed-point precision numbers](https://github.com/delvtech/fixedpointmath#readme) for arithmetic.
